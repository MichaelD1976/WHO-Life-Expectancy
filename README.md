WHO Life Expectancy Analysis
##### About the data
The WHO (World Health Organization) collects information via the Global Health Observatory data repository on numerous health factors. Economic data is obtained via the United Nations website. The data files, available for public access, have been condensed to selected features, merged and made available as a single data file on the Kaggle website (source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). The data spans from 2000 to 2015 and is made up of 2938 rows representing 193 countries. 
##### Objectives of this analysis
- What are the main factors affecting life expectancy?
- To what extent do selected features of 'status', 'schooling', 'hiv/aids', 'gdp', 'measles', 'polio' and 'infant_deaths' influence life expectancy?
- Provide visual representations of the relationships of these selected features with life expectancy
- Show how life expectancy rates have changed through time
- Perform hypothesis testing to ascertain if there is a statistically significant difference in life expectancy between developed and developing countries
- Train and evaluate various classification models to predict whether a country is developed or developing, given the values of our selected features
